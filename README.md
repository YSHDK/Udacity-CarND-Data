This repository contains data collected from Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator, a deprecated resource used for the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program. The data consists of images captured by three front cameras (Left, Center, Right) during simulated driving sessions and their corresponding steering angles at each time step, stored in a CSV file.

Data Format:

Images: Stored in separate folders for Left, Center, and Right cameras. Image format (e.g., JPG, PNG) will be specified in the README file.
Steering Angles: Stored in a CSV file named driving_log.csv. The format of the CSV file will be documented in the README.
Disclaimer:

This data is derived from a deprecated simulator and might not reflect the latest advancements in self-driving car technology. It is intended for educational and research purposes only.

Potential Use Cases:

Training and validating self-driving car algorithms
Studying car behavior under simulated conditions
Benchmarking self-driving car performance
Additional Information:

A README file will be included with detailed information about the data collection process, data format, and usage recommendations.
The simulator used for data collection is deprecated, but the data format might be compatible with similar car simulation environments.
